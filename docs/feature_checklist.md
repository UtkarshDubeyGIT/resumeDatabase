# Resumint — Master Feature Checklist

> **Purpose**: This is the single source of truth for every user-facing and system-level feature
> across all four development phases. The AI agent building this application MUST reference
> this document before, during, and after implementing each phase to ensure **no feature is
> left unbuilt**. Mark items `[x]` only when fully implemented and verified.
